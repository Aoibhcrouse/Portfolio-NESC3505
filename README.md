Hi everyone! My name is Aoibh (pronounced 'Eve') Crouse and I am in my 3rd year at Dalhousie getting my bachelors in Neuroscience. I have created this portfolio for mt Neural Data Science course (NESC 3505), in which this was the final project, I hope you enjoy!

Pandas DataFrames

Every data scientist who works with very large data sets needs to be able to use the pandas library and know how to manipulate it to get the desired outcome.

Here is an example of [exploratory data analysis](EDA.md)
