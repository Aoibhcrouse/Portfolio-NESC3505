<h1><b>Hi everyone!</b></h1>

My name is Aoibh (pronounced 'Eve') Crouse and I am in my 3rd year at Dalhousie getting my bachelors in Neuroscience. I have created this portfolio for mt Neural Data Science course (NESC 3505), in which this was the final project, I hope you enjoy!

<h2>Pandas DataFrames</h2>

Every data scientist who works with very large data sets needs to be able to use the pandas library and know how to manipulate it to get the desired outcome.

Here is an example of how to [use and manipulate pandas dataframes](PandasDataFrameManipulation.md).

<h2>Visualization</h2>

When wanting to interpret and present your data, you may decide that using graphs is the best choice.

Here is an example of how to [visualize data from data frames](Visualization.md)

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

Another tool useful when interpreting data is using statistical analysis (like T-tests or ANOVA tests).

Here is an example of [exploratory data analysis](EDA.md)

<h2>Neuroimaging Data using MRI<h2>
  
 Working as a neural data scientist, it is very important to be able to work with MRI data and know how to properly display it.
  
 Here is an example of [MRI data manipulation]
